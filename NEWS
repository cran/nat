nat 1.0
=======
* implement reading of amiramesh data
* including amira SkeletonGraph format tracings
* switch to filehashRDS format for repositories of remote neurons
* retire stashR backend for neuronlistfh remote repositories (too slow)

nat 0.9
=======
* support for automatic download of neurons from stashR remote repositories on
  the web. ?neuronlistfh for details and an example. 
* Relies on stashR package
* dev: small doc fixes to make package CRAN compatible.

nat 0.8
=======
* important new feature: neuronlistfh objects backed by an on disk filehash
  allow single neurons to be loaded from disk on demand
* this allows 1) fast startup suitable for knitr documents and 2) working with
  more neurons than fit in main memory
* of course this is slower than working with an in-memory list but for plotting
  etc this should not be problem
* furthermore neuronlistfh objects can be subsetted/converted to give in memory
  neuronlist objects.

nat 0.7
=======
* implement read.neuron and read.neurons
* so far only works for rda, rds and swc files
* reading of additional file types will be implemented by registering functions =
  to test, read and write for the format using a package regsistry controlled by
  nat::neuronformats.
* developer: seglists in neurons now have class 'seglist'

nat 0.6
=======
* major new functionality - bidirectional interconversion of graph and regular
  neuron representation
* see as.neuron.* methods and as.ngraph.* methods
* plan is to use graph representation as the common intermediate with reading 
  different neuron file formats
* depends on igraph package

nat 0.5.2
=========
* add subset.neuronlist
* add methods for working with dataframe attached to neuronlist 
  (see e.g. ?with.neuronlist)
* TODO harmonise plot3d.neuronlist subset expressions with subset.neuronlist

nat 0.5.1
=========
* Switch license to GPL-3
* xform (transformation) of hxsurf objects
* fix xform of neuronlist objects
* switch from CMTK gregxform to streamxform (gregxform is deprecated; streamxform can concatenate registrations)
* teach mirror function to accept numeric axis specification
* Fix bug in checking extra directories in cmtk.bindir
* Add dotprops.neuronlist and include all dotprops methods in documentation
* Fix longstanding bug in parsing cmtk warping registrations (only relevant for
  reading these into R lists - no effect on transformations).
* fix bug in class of cmtkreg objects
* Remove call to .Internal(La_rs) by calling eigen directly
* doc: some notes on CMTK installation

nat 0.5
=======
* fix broken handling of cmtk affine transformations
* implement mirroring of neurons and other objects
* teach xformpoints (and therefore xform) to handle "~/" in paths
* bugfix in visibility of S3method xformpoints.character
* (developer) Switch to roxygen2 v3.0 for documentation

nat 0.4
=======
* read.hxsurf and plot3d.hxsurf for reading/plotting Amira surfaces
* better handling of location of cmtk command line tools see ?cmtk for details
* add neuronlist and associated methods (including plot)
* plot3d for neurons and dotprops

nat 0.3
=======
* basic and self-contained implementation of neuron class
* basic and self-contained implementation of dotprops
* new xform generic + methods for clean transformation of objects including
  neurons and dotprops objects
* this includes improved interaction between dotprops and xform so that xform
  can use the previously value of k when recalculating a dotprops object post
  transformation
* sample data (40 PNs from Jefferis, Potter et al. '07 and 20 KCs from Chiang 
  et al. 2011)
* 1 use of .Internal and missing nlapply remain to be fixed.

nat 0.2.1
=========
* fix install error due to missing neuron(*).R files that contain docs only so far

nat 0.2
=======
* Fairly complete implementation of CMTK registration I/O and geometry
* All functionality is self-contained (i.e. independent of nat.as/AnalysisSuite)
* passes check()
* can be augmented by nat.as (0.6)
